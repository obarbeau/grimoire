Grimoire was hacked in 24hrs by [Reid McKenzie](http://arrdem.com/)
and [César Bolaños](https://github.com/cesarbp), and serves to provide
web documentation of the [Clojure](http://clojure.org/) language with
community contributed commentary and examples.

Since then, Grimoire has continued to evolve and now features examples
sourced from [ClojureDocs](http://clojuredocs.org) as well as user
submitted content.

Grimoire version `0.3.0` was made possible by
[Robert Stuttaford](https://github.com/robert-stuttaford), who helped
port Grimoire from the original Jekyll static site to a real Clojure
webapp and for whose assistance we are immensely grateful.

Grimoire, while free to you, isn't free to operate. At present,
running Grimoire costs about $10 a month to keep online and gets much
more than that in ongoing development time. As I'm still in school, if
you find yourself using Grimoire routinely I'd ask that you
[support the project](https://www.gittip.com/arrdem) by helping me
cover the hosting and coffee costs of keeping it online and useful.
